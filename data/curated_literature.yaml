    year: 2022
    journal: "J. Phys. Chem. B"
    doi: "10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c04188"
    finding: "AlphaFold2 structure of 0239 aligned to B. subtilis EzrA (PDB) via FATCAT; 498/595 residues (84%) well-aligned. Spectrin-like repeats and single TM segment consistent with EzrA architecture. Conserved genomic context: thiL-0239-rpsB matches thiL-ezrA-rpsB synteny in Gram-positive bacteria."
    evidence_type: "computational structural alignment"
    methods: ["AlphaFold2", "FATCAT", "HHPred", "genomic context"]
  notes: "Strongest evidence for EzrA-like FtsZ filament negative regulator assignment. Gene is present in both syn3.0 (JCVISYN3_0239, CP014940.1) and syn3A — it was NOT one of the 19 genes added back."
