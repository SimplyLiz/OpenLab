## Introduction

Cancer genomics has revolutionized our understanding of tumor biology. Recent advances in
sequencing technology have enabled comprehensive profiling of somatic mutations across
diverse tumor types.

## Materials and Methods

### Cell Culture

HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin
at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were passaged every 3 days using
0.25% trypsin-EDTA and cultured in 10 cm dishes.

### RNA Extraction and RNA-seq

Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer, and samples with RIN > 8 were selected for sequencing.

RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA kit with
500 ng of total RNA input. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000
platform, generating 150 bp paired-end reads at a depth of 30 million reads per sample.

### Differential Expression Analysis

Raw sequencing reads were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using STAR
v2.7.9a with default parameters. Gene-level counts were generated using featureCounts
from the Subread package. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2
v1.34.0 in R. Genes with adjusted p-value < 0.05 and |log2 fold change| > 1 were
considered differentially expressed.

### Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

GSEA was performed using the fgsea R package with gene sets from MSigDB v7.5.
Pathways with FDR < 0.25 were considered significantly enriched.

### Western Blot

Protein lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors.
30 µg of total protein was separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF
membranes. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight,
followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature.

### Variant Calling

Somatic variant calling was performed on whole exome sequencing data using GATK
Mutect2 following GATK best practices. Variants were filtered using FilterMutectCalls
and annotated using Funcotator.

## Results

We identified 1,247 differentially expressed genes between treatment and control groups.
